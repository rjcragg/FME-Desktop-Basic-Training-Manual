# What is FME?
**FME (the Feature Manipulation Engine)** is a data translation and transformation tool for solving problems of data interoperability. 

It is a way to integrate multiple data sources without the need for coding.

## Extract, Transform, and Load
FME is sometimes classed as an **ETL** application. ETL stands for Extract, Transform and Load. It is a data warehousing tool that extracts data from multiple sources (here A and B), transforms it to fit the users’ needs and loads it into a destination or data warehouse (C).

While most ETL tools process only tabular data, FME also has the geoprocessing capabilities required to handle spatial datasets.
